# Code Projects
The Robocar was the first project, it's main goal was to run wheels connected to a Raspberry PI which the code ran on.



The Face Tracking Camera, is a mix of Facial Regonizition, which once it's Regonized a face, it sends data to it's Arduino Slave to move a platform to track that face.




The Geolocation Website is used in combination with a GPS chip. The Chip itself sends it's GPS to a database, in which the website retrieves it from, and puts it up for viewing on a map. The Website also handles Log on, Security and has a mini-shareable forum for experiences.
